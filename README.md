## Game Overview

The game starts when player clicks start and he will be given 100 dollars, which is displayed in the screen.
A prompt will show up, reminding the player to make a bet, so the game can start. After player makes a bet (which always needs to be more than his current bankroll), cards will be distributed for both player and dealer. Player's cards are both show and the dealer will only show one card until player stands.
Player can only make one bet until hand is over.

Player can keep getting cards as long as he does not passes over 21, by pushing the HIT button.
On this game version, A is worth 1 point. (This will be fixed soon).
When game gets completely fixed, then we can use the rule of an A being 1 or 11.
In that case, if points are less or equals to ten, replace the value of card for 11 points instead of 1.
If after replacing the value of Ace for 11 points the player goes over 21, then value of Ace can be 1 again and continue playing until passes 21 (when he looses) or decides to stop.

If player does not get busted, he can choose to stop receiving cards by clicking the STAND button. After he clicks the stand button, the dealer will start playing.
Same conditions description above, except dealer cannot get more cards if he passes 17 and then his game stops. If he didn't pass 21 after passing the 17 points, the we will move to verify the winner.

After both player and dealer stop playing, points on both cards array needs to be compared and the one closer to 21 will win.
If both dealer and player are tie, then player only receives back the money he initially added on his bet.

Paying the winner: If player looses, money in pot gets deducted from his account
if player wins he receives double the amount he bet (his bet plus the same amount paid by dealer).

New hand: if player still has money after loosing a hand, he can play again and everything gets called completely again.
He can play as many times until he has no money.

## Syntax:
Capital letters = big objects

[] = arrays

() = functions

{} = little objects

### Global Variables

Card ()
//Makes a single card which contains name, suit and points as properties

Deck()
//Uses a constructor to make all cards in the deck grabbing an array of cards (deck) and resets so this function can only be created once preventing making multiple decks.

Deck.prototype.draw()
//Takes as a parameter of number, where number is the name of cards to be drawn from the deck. Also, these drawn cards will be removed from the deck.

Deck.prototype.reset()
//Makes unique Cards for a deck containing card name, suit and points. Taking in consideration that J, Q and K are worth 10 points.

Deck.prototype.shuffle()
//Takes the Deck of cards and shuffles them to be displayed randomly


### App Object

playerCards: [],
* Contains cards from the show for the player to use

dealerCards:[],
* Contains cards from the show for the dealer to use

pot: 0
* Hold the money amount on bet

initCredit: 100,
* Initial credit for the player when the game starts

playerStand: false
* Initially set to false, so can be used as a check point to initiate the playerHit function

dealerStand: false
* Initially set to false, so can be used as a check point to initiate the dealerHit function

bet()
* This function calls the UI.amountBet and deducts the value of the bet input from the initCredit of 100. This function also pushes the amount to the pot to keep track of the amount of money in the player's bankroll.

bankroll()
* This function checks if the player can continue playing as long as he has money.
If the credit is grater than zero, then this can call the bet function again, allowing him to play.

startGame()
* Creates a new deck and shuffles it. Initiates the bankroll so we can start keeping track of the players money. Also, gives cards to the player and dealer. They both receive two. Cards are being pushed into each ones array playerCards[] and dealerCards[].

playerHit()
* Checks first if playerStand is false, if so, then checks the cards on the playerCards[] array. If he is less than 21, he can draw more cards, If he passes 21 he looses and is the end of the hand.

playersCanPlay()
* This function takes a hand as a parameter, which can be either the player or dealer's hand. The purpose of this function is to keep track of the points inside of an array, in this case the player cards and dealer cards.

dealerHit()
* Checks first if dealers cards are less than 17.If so, he will get another card. If he passes 17 points, no more cards will be given to him and both players get compared to see which one has points closer to 21 without busting.

decidingWinner()
* Decides who will win according to the rules of the game. If the player wins, then the money and the pot will get multiplied by two and goes to the player bankroll, which basically gives him his money from the bet and the match the dealer pays him.
